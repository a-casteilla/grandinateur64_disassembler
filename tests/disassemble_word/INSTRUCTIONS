Type "make" :
this will compile the file with the right flags, then it will run the test.
vimdiff will be running so you can compare out.txt (the effective output) and
expected_output.txt
One extra line may appear in out.txt. This is a side effect of scanf and the
detection of the end of the file. This has nothing to do with the tested
function.
