Before running the test, you have to install the disassembler with the command : 
# make install
in the disassembler directory. You may have to install it as root (with sudo
for example). Take the time to check the Makefile before running it as root. 
DON'T TRUST ME, AND MY MAKEFILE !

Then, run "test" in this directory :
this will run the test five times with different command-line parameter.
vimdiff will run after so you can compare each output with the expected result.
